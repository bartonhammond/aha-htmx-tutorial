  <h4>Tutorials</h4>
  <p>
    Included are <a href="/posts/">28 Short Tutorials</a> that describe how HTMX
    was implemened following this guide:
    <a href="https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/">Hypermedia Systems</a>
    and how all these technologies were used and how to deploy this application to
    Fly.io
  </p>

  <p style="color:red">
    Please note: these tutorials were written as the code was developed but when
    deployment was done, there were numerous changes required. So look at the
    final code to see how things turned out.

            blogs, marketing, and e-commerce. Astro is best-known for pioneering

          <p>
            htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and
            Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can
            build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of

          <p>
            Alpine is a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in
            your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a
            script tag and get going. Alpine is a collection of 15 attributes, 6
            properties, and 2 methods.
