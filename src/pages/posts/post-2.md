# Overview
The **HSb** uses different technologies so we have to translate the requirements to what works for AHA.

With this first commit, we will have Astro installed and Pocketbase (**PB**).  We'll use **PB** to load some data. 

## What to do
*  First clone the project: [https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial](https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial)

*  Download **PB** and install into `/pb`  directory.  Follow the instructions here: [https://pocketbase.io/docs/](https://pocketbase.io/docs/)

*  Start **PB** by running this command in a terminal   `./scripts/start.sh`

*  Using your browser, go to link as provided in the terminal as shown here:



## What's next
Go through the tutorials / blogs and use the GitHub site I provided to raise issues or questions.
