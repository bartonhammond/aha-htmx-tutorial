# Overview
The **HSb** uses different technologies (Python, Flask, Jinja2) so we have to translate the requirements to what works for AHA.

With this first commit, we will have Astro installed and Pocketbase (**PB**).  We'll use **PB** to load some data. This will confirm that **PB** is installed and setup properly.

## Fork, clone, and checkout specific commit
*  First **fork** the project: [https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial](https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial).  Note: be sure to **uncheck** the `Copy the master branch only` so that you have all the commits

*  Then, clone the repo you just forked so that you'll have a local copy to work with

*  Next, we're going to checkout a specific commit so we can review the code.

*  Click the "commits" button to view all the commits

*  Scroll down the commits and click the specific hash of the "Initial Commit".

Then use that hash to checkout. It should be this hash: `eff53a8537124d3fcfb3e47909485ce0a89bea48`
