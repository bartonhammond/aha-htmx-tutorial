# Overview
Before starting this project, I had no serious experience with any of these technologies other than just reading about them.  I am very interested in having a tech stack that is simple and straigt forward.  For me, this stack scratchs that itch.  

 I had looked through the AHA Stack docs and read about it.  And I knew that Flavio had started working through the Hypermedia Systems (**HSb**) book (see [https://ahastack.dev/examples/2-contacts/](https://ahastack.dev/examples/2-contacts/)).  He didn't complete it so I thought I would.

This tutorial will not so much be a "code along" but rather a `code review`.  We'll review the code that I used to.

## Assumptions

I will not be providing detail instructions of how to use GitHub or install Astro, etc.  I assume these type of things are better discussed at their websites.

I am doing this on a Mac.  If you are on a different machine, good luck :)

I assume you have `npm` and `node` installed.

## What I'll be sharing

1. All the source code to the project.  I'll be using GitHub see: [https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial]()

2. We'll go through the **HSb** and create review the solution in the AHA stack.

3. We'll review the code that was created. We'll review each GitHub **commit** that was used.

## What's next
What we're going to do is to checkout each commit that was made to this project.  That way we can review the code.
