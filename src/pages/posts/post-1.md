# Overview
Before starting this project, I had no serious experience with any of these technologies other than
just reading about them.  I am very interested in having a tech stack that is simple and straigt forward.  For me, this stack scratchs that itch.  

 I had looked through the AHA Stack docs and read about it.  And I knew that Flavio had started working through the Hypermedia Systems (**HSb**) book (see [https://ahastack.dev/examples/2-contacts/](https://ahastack.dev/examples/2-contacts/)).  He didn't complete it so I thought I would.

## Assumptions

I will not be providing detail instructions of how to use GitHub or install Astro, etc.  I assume these type of things are better discussed at their websites.

I am doing this on a Mac.  If you are on a different machine, good luck :)

## What I'll be sharing

1. All the source code to the project.  I'll be using GitHub see: [https://github.com/bartonhammond/aha-htmx-tutorial]()

2. I'll go through the **HSb** and create the solution in the AHA stack.

3. I'll discuss the code that was used. I'll point out what GitHub **commit** was used.

## What's next
Go through the tutorials / blogs and use the GitHub site I provided to raise issues or questions.
